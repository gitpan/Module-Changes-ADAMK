NAME
    Module::Changes::ADAMK - Parse a traditional Changes file (as ADAMK
    interpretes it)

SYNOPSIS
      my $changes  = Module::Changes::ADAMK->read('Changes');
      my $latest   = $changes->current;
      my $datetime = $changes->datetime; # DateTime object

DESCRIPTION
    This module was written for parsing ADAMK's Changes files (which are a
    pretty traditional format that might be of us to others).

    It is provided to the CPAN community for discussion and testing
    purposes.

    It is currently not documented in detail, see the source code for the
    API.
